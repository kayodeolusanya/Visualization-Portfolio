# Visualization-Portfolio

Welcome to my personal data-visualization portfolio. This site showcases a curated collection of semester-long assignments and projects. Each project includes code, visuals (charts or infographics), and commentary — giving a full picture of my approach to data storytelling and analysis.

🎯  What you’ll find here

Clear, clean interface with a hero banner, project cards, and an “About Me” section.

Five main projects, each with its own dedicated page including:

📌 Storyboard project: “The Price of a Dream” - a human-centred narrative of an immigrant journey.

🌍 Interactive map redesign: “New Age John Snow’s Map” - a modern take on a classic information graphic.

📊 Infographic on unemployment: “Unemployment in Canada” - a persuasive infographic on a topical issue.

📈 Data story on food affordability & AI: exploring pandemic-era food access and AI’s effects.

📉 Correlation analysis: “Price, Rating & Reviews” - visual storytelling of product metrics and their relationships.

About / Contact section summarizing my background, tools I use (Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, ArcGIS, Canva, etc.), and a contact link.

🛠️ Tech & Tools Used

Static site built with plain HTML & CSS, hosted via GitHub Pages.

Visualizations and data analysis done in Python, using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, with interactive or design-based outputs via ArcGIS, Flourish, and Canva.

Clean layout and responsive design to look good on desktop and mobile screens.

✅ Why this portfolio matters

This site isn’t just a showcase of visuals, it’s a demonstration of process, storytelling, and data literacy. Each project captures not only the final image or map, but also the underlying analysis, design decisions, and purpose. For someone evaluating my skills (e.g. a potential employer or collaborator), this portfolio shows:

Good data-to-visual mapping and clarity.

Ability to work with real data, generate insights, and present them effectively.

A clean, readable, and navigable web presentation.
